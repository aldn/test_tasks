# Brackets

Lets assume that there is a string containing, amongst other symbols, brackets of N different types,
like (] {} () <> «», etc. You need to implement algorithm that validates that an input stream 
contains properly paired and nested brackets of several types, in other words checks
whether the given string is a valid bracket sequence or not. For instance these strings
"()[]{({})}" "[([]{})]" are valid, but these ones "[(])[]", "[[[{})))", "[)" are not.
